# Web Tool


## Why?
The 灵 (Ling) project leverages TTS and ASR (speech recognition) models to deliver an immersive, voice-to-voice AI companion experience.

While ASR and TTS technologies are powerful on their own, setting them up can be challenging. Previously, although our users installed the TTS and ASR models into our project, they were exclusively accessible as a part of Ling's AI companion feature, preventing their use for other purposes like transcription or speech generation.

## What is Web Tool?

This is a dedicated web page within the 灵 (Ling) backend that provides direct access to the ASR and TTS models initialized by the 灵 (Ling) server.

Access the web page at: http://localhost:12393/web-tool. Note that the ASR and TTS models are the same ones you've set in the `conf.yaml` file, and switching models at runtime is not possible at this point.
